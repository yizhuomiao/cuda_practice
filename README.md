My coding practice while learning the CUDA C programming and parallel programming. 

My reference materials: 
- [CS194-15 Introduction to Parallel Programming](
  https://sites.google.com/lbl.gov/cs194-15-fa2020/);
- Professional CUDA C Programming. John Cheng, Max Grossman, Ty McKercher.
- [An Even Easier Introduction to CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/even-easier-introduction-cuda/);
- [Building Cross-Platform CUDA Applications with CMake](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=https%3A//developer.nvidia.com/blog/building-cuda-applications-cmake/)

These codes are written and tested on my ROG G14 laptop, which has a 2060 mobile gpu. Since I like compling and debugging my codes in the command line tool, I'm using Ubuntu 21.04 on my laptop. [About how to install UBUNTU on G14](https://www.reddit.com/r/ZephyrusG14/comments/hfr0d5/state_of_linux_on_the_g14/). For Ubuntu 21.04, remember to use runfile(local) to install the CUDA toolkit because of the driver compatbility.

Nvidia Driver Version: 465.27   
CUDA Version: 11.3

I also tried a few gpu cloud servers on google cloud and Aliyun at first. They are fine to use, but are too expencive for a beginner learner like me.
